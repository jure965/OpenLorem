# OpenLorem

API client for Lorem Ipsum providers as WebExtension.

## TODO

- make beautiful icons/logo
- make beautiful UI
- add more providers
- add copy to clipboard functionality
- add insert into page functionality

## Currently supported Lorem Ipsum providers

- [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/)
- [Loripsum.net](http://loripsum.net/)

## Where do I get the extension?

It will be published on AMO after it gets icons, nicer UI and more providers.

For now you can clone it and [install](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) it as temporary extension for [debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging) purposes in Firefox.

For Chrome you can go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode and click "load unpacked extension" then select folder with manifest.json file.

## Should I contribute?

Yes!

## How?

One way is to fork, make changes, commit and make pull request.

You have your own Lorem Ipsum API? Let me know and I will add it.
